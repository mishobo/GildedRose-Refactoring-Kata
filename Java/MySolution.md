### understand the problem and the objective:
- refactor the updateQuality method [ implement clean code practices ] and add conjured items

### How to implement the goal to the problem [ refactor the method and add conjured ]
- the principle to consider is clean code, which are:-
                   * DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself,
                   * KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid,
                   * test cases [ unit and integration ],
                   * YAGNI - You Ain't Gonna Need It
                   * SOLID - Single responsibility,
                           - Open to extension/closed for modification
                           - Liskov substitution
                           - Interface segregation
                           - Dependency inversion
                   * Descriptive classes, methods and variables
                   * keep methods shorts [ max 20 lines ]
                   * comments and documentation
                   * consistent formatting and indentation
                   * Error handling
                   * Meaningful whitespaces
                   * Version control

- In my opinion, Test, DRY, KISS, Comments for documentation will apply here.
