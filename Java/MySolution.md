### understand the problem and the objective:
- refactor the updateQuality method [ implement clean code practices ] and add conjured items

### How to implement the goal to the problem [ refactor the method and add conjured ]
- the principle to consider is clean code, which are:-
                   * DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself,
                   * KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid,
                   * test cases [ unit and integration ],
                   * YAGNI - You Ain't Gonna Need It
                   * SOLID - Single responsibility,
                           - Open to extension/closed for modification
                           - Liskov substitution
                           - Interface segregation
                           - Dependency inversion
                   * Descriptive classes, methods and variables
                   * keep methods shorts [ max 20 lines ]
                   * comments and documentation
                   * consistent formatting and indentation
                   * Error handling
                   * Meaningful whitespaces
                   * Version control

- In my opinion, Test, DRY, KISS, Comments for documentation will apply here.

* What is refactoring?
- Based on Robert C Martins blog post-27 May 2013, The Transformation Priority Premise.
- Refactoring is simple operations that change the structure of code without changing its behavior.
- Transformations are simple operations that change the behavior of code.
- Transformations can be used as the sole means for passing the currently failing test in the red/green/refactor cycle.

“As the tests get more specific, the code gets more generic.”

### Code Smell
- tangible and observable violations of code design/development fundamentals that could eventually lead to poor code quality and technical debt.

### Technical debt:
- the cost of rework is caused by choosing quicker, easier solutions over more optimal ones in software development.
